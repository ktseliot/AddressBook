1You should use rspec to test your classes, and use irb to load your file and
debug them manually.
Question 1. Write a new Person class that implements the following interface:person = Person.new("joe", "bloggs", "1 Jan 1990") # The date should be optionalperson.dob # => A Date objectperson.first_name # => "Joe"person.surname # => "Bloggs"person.fullname # => "Joe Bloggs"person.emails # => []person.add_email "joe@foo.com"person.add_email "joe.bloggs@work.com"person.emails # => ["joe@foo.com", "joe.bloggs@work.com"]person.phone_numbers # => []person.add_phone "07712345678"person.add_phone "02012345678"person.phone_numbers # => ["07712345678", "02012345678"]person.remove_email(0)person.emails # => ["joe.bloggs@work.com"]person.to_s# => "Joe Bloggs was born on 1990-01-01.\n Their email addresses are: [\"joe@foo.com\"].\n Their phone numbers are [\"07712345678\", \"02012345678\"]"Additional Constraints:•Emails should be stored in an array, so should phone numbers.•It should not be possible to change the emails or phone numbers arrays except using the add_email, add_phone, remove_emailand remove_phonemethods.•The Array method delete_atmight be usefu

Question 2.Add a print_detailsmethod that prints out the details of the person, and then lists their emails and phone numbers on separate lines. You should use the Array method each.The stftimeDate method might be useful.You should only try to write tests for this once you have finished everything else. Here’s a suggested output format:Joe Bloggs----------Date of Birth: 01 January 1990Email Addresses:-joe@foo.com-joe.bloggs@work.comPhone Numbers:-02012345678


Revision 1.00 –August 14Question 3. Add a FamilyMemberclass that inherits from Person and has an additional relationshipinstance variable.Question 4. Write an AddressBookclass that implements the following interface. Note: It is verydifficult to write tests for the list()method, since it prints stuff to STDOUT, rather than returning it.person1 = Person.new("joe", "blogs", "1 Jan 1990")person2 = Person.new("andy", "nother", "2 Jan 1995")book = AddressBook.newbook.add person1book.add person2book.list # Should print this to the command line:Address Book------------Entry 1: Joe BloggsEntry 2: Andy NotherBonus points:•Raisean error if the add method is passed anything but a Person or FamilyMemberobject
